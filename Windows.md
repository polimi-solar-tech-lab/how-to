# Cheat Sheet
Command prompt or Powershell
- Show files and folders in current directory: `dir`
- Go into folder (change directory): `cd some_folder`
- Go back out of folder: `cd ..` 
- Go anywhere: `cd "C:\path\to\Where You Want\to\go"`
- Clear screen: `cls`

# PATH Variable
- Kind of like a shortcut directory, so in command prompt (or any other shell) you can just type "my_program.exe" and it runs without needing all the C:\Users\.. Etc
- Search "Advanced System Settings" > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path > Edit
